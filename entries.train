0	650122	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	0	A New Plan for Japan
0	650123	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	1	From the Wall Street Journal today , I found an interesting article about the future plan of Japan .
0	650124	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	2	The article is from the Review & Outlook section .
0	650125	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	3	The title is `` A New Plan for Japan `` .
0	650126	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	4	URL
0	650127	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	5	As far as I am concerned , the article clearly suggests three main solutions for Japan 's problems .
1	650128	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	6	Actually , there are not only three solutions in the article , but I just picked up three solutions .	Actually , there are not only three solutions in the article , but I just picked out three solutions .
0	650129	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	7	I felt this was a good article for both Japanese and foreign people to understand Japan 's current situation .
0	650130	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	8	The first solution is to lower corporate and personal taxes .
0	650131	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	9	The taxes in Japan are relatively higher than those in most of other developed countries .
0	650132	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	10	To signal young leaders that entrepreneurship will be rewarded , this solution is important .
0	650133	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	11	The second solution is pension reform to control the exploding cost of old - age payouts .
0	650134	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	12	As you may know , Japan has the second lowest birthrate .
1	650135	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	13	This will result in rapid aging society with fewer children .	This will result in a rapidly aging society with fewer children .
0	650136	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	14	The current pension system was mainly created in 1985 .
0	650137	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	15	I think it 's already outdated .
0	650138	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	16	The third solution is immigration reform .
0	650139	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	17	As mentioned above , because Japan will become the aging society with fewer children , Japan needs people from foreign countries .
0	650140	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	18	However , inviting foreign people are not easy due to the following two reasons .
0	650141	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	19	First , Japan is an island country , so many Japanese people have not had much opportunity to communicate with foreign people .
0	650142	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	20	Second , many Japanese people can not speak foreign languages very well .
0	650143	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	21	This solution is easy to say , but not easy to implement .
0	650144	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	22	The longer Japan delays , the harder it will be to implement the solutions .
0	650145	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	23	To improve the current situation is really difficult , but it seems to me that it is possible .
0	650146	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	24	I believe Japan can thrive again with the right leader and the right reforms .
0	650147	http://lang-8.com/70153/journals/982345	25	I also want to be of some help to revive Japan .

0	819012	http://lang-8.com/40149/journals/118202	7	I had to shft to better one , more fruitful one , even obeying that inertia .

0	261877	http://lang-8.com/9067/journals/78964	9	I also work with many stakeholders , so I work overtime every day .
0	261878	http://lang-8.com/9067/journals/78964	10	I envy some employees who work individually because they can perfectly control their work time and they will take advantage of this system .
0	261879	http://lang-8.com/9067/journals/78964	11	The aim of this system is to improve the employee satisfaction ; however , it might increase the unfairness among the employees in different departments .

0	838814	http://lang-8.com/236564/journals/842486	26	Not only do I not remember many rules of Russian language , but I often stumble upon some linguistic structures ( supposedly , the remnant knowledge of my Russian and Literature classes , scattered across the memory ) which I am eager to employ in my speech , but find myself wondering if they are correct , and end up rephrasing it all in several variations , one after another .

0	726034	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	1	Hi ,
0	726035	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	2	How are you doing everybody ?
0	726036	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	3	As I said earlier I 'm a beginner in studying Japanese .
0	726037	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	4	Today I had this question in my head and I could n't do anything because of it . I know it 's a stupid question but not knowing the answer bothered me alot .
0	726038	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	5	The question is , `` How do japanese people know the end of every word or every sentence ? `` . when I googled it , this is what I found , `` Notice there are no spaces between words .
0	726039	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	6	You will need to practice reading the same sentences over and over again to get used to where words begin and end without getting confused . `` .
0	726040	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	7	Is this what actually happens in reality ? ! ! because it seems impossible for every single japanese individual to study all the words and sentences that he / she is going to encounter in his life .
0	726041	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	8	This just does n't seem reasonable .
0	726042	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	9	So is this true or there is a better way to tell when a word is completed ?
0	726043	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/339739	10	Please help because it 's driving me nuts !

0	849119	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	3	Unarguably , if we take a step further to accept it as the cornerstone of any teaching method , we will be astonished to see the whole range of possibilities which will open up .

The point on which I could take issue with the author lies in how to create the right environment for the language acquisition to happen , given that each person is strikingly different .
0	849121	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	5	There were students in my teaching practice who could not stand bright light and felt safer with shut windows .
0	849122	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	6	Yet , they were making impressive progress in spite of the teacher suffering in the dark about what was going on .
0	849123	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	7	On the other hand , there have always been a considerable number of ambitious students who will find pride and joy in doing tests and all sorts of ' dull ' work .
0	849124	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	8	Indeed , is there anything more attractive and pleasing in terms of language learning than passing an exam with flying colours ?
0	849125	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	9	However , in the era of maximum comfort it is little wonder that an unprecedented number of learners prefer fun and relaxation accompanied by a cup of coffee and soothing music in the background .
1	849126	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	10	The thing I feel strongly about is that it seems unfair to defy traditional education on the grounds that it fails to meet every student 's needs .

0	849128	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	12	' Beautiful Things Work Better ' is what the author is trying to make us believe .
0	849129	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	13	Unquestionably , when stuck between nasty weather and daunting deadlines it looks very much so .
1	849130	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	14	Nevertheless , if we dare take a closer look at creativity ( and what is learning if not a fascinating mixture of experimenting , forming , shaping , producing and the like ? ) then we have to admit that , in the long run , successfulness is not a bed of roses , albeit highly rewarded in the end .	Nevertheless , if we dare take a closer look at creativity , ( and what is learning if not a fascinating mixture of experimenting , forming , shaping , producing and the like ? ) , then we have to admit that , in the long run , success is not a bed of roses , albeit highly rewarded in the end .
0	849131	http://lang-8.com/45637/journals/899439	15	Finally , I would like to thank the author for touching on the issue of aesthetics in language teaching and learning , which appears to be among the most effective features nowadays .

0	147236	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	1	On March 11th , Tohoku region was devastated by earthquake and washed away by Tsunami .
1	147237	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	2	Up to now , the death toll reaches at least fifteen thousand and ten thousand people are still missing .	Up to now , the death toll has reached up to at least fifteen thousand , and ten thousand people are still missing .
0	147238	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	3	Everyone would be really shocked by the horrible scene .
0	147239	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	4	However , we have to make a gradual advance toward a revival .
0	147240	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	5	Therefore , I would like to propose three plans that we university students can do for the region .
0	147241	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	6	First of all , since we relatively afford to do a volunteer work because of long vacations in summer and spring , we should do so for them .
1	147242	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	7	According to TV news , there is still a lot of debris in devastated area .	According to TV news , there is still a lot of debris in the devastated area .
1	147243	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	8	That is , it is necessary to remove it immediately for revitalizing there .	, It is necessary to remove it immediately so reconstruction can begin .
0	147244	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	9	In terms of this work , we will be able to do so without any knowledge .
1	147245	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	10	Also , the region has a serious problem on education environment .	Also , the disaster had a serious impact on the education environment in that region .
1	147246	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	11	Because of the chain of disaster , the children in the region have not got enough education .	Because of the chain of natural disasters , the children in the region have not been able to get enough education .
1	147247	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	12	Therefore , since we have knowledge to teach them study to some extent , we will be able to provide the education with them .	Therefore , since we have knowledge , we can teach them and help them study to some extent ; we will be able to provide them with education .
0	147248	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	13	In addition to the volunteer work , by taking other ways , we can also contribute to the revival .
0	147249	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	14	Presently , the region is in the middle of a dire depression .
0	147250	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	15	In order to pull the economy out of recession , it goes without saying that our corporation is necessary .
0	147251	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	16	Let me introduce one example .
1	147252	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	17	What we can do is to buy as many products made in the region as we can .	We can buy as many products made in the region as we can .
0	147253	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	18	Thanks to that , the economic will be stimulated and people will be able to get new jobs .
0	147254	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	19	Moreover , even if we do not have enough time to do such a volunteer work or do not afford to buy them a lot , you still have an option to help for them .
0	147255	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	20	At the present , the companies carrying out Socially Responsible Investment or SRI become the center of public attention gradually .
1	147256	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	21	At first , let me explain the SRI in detail .	First , let me explain the SRI in detail .
0	147257	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	22	It is one of the strategies to not only sell products but also contribute to the society .
0	147258	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	23	Until recently , most of Japanese people had chosen the product from their points of view such as quality , price and others .
1	147259	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	24	However , in addition to the points , the factor of social contribution is being needed .	However , in addition to these points , social contribution should also be taken in account .
0	147260	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	25	For instance , there are two clothing stores .
1	147261	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	26	The former invest 100 yen per a cloth for Tohoku region .	The former invests 100 yen per piece of cloth for the Tohoku region .
0	147262	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	27	Meanwhile , the latter does nothing about it .
1	147263	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	28	If we buy the same kind of a cloth , we will buy it from the former .	If we plan on buying the same kind of a cloth , we will buy it from the former .
0	147264	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	29	That is , by buying the products , we can easily donate and contribute to the development of society .
1	147265	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	30	Therefore , if you want to do so , I would like you to find such companies carrying out SRI from variety industries .	Therefore , if you are interested , I would like you to find companies carrying out SRI
0	147266	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	31	In conclusion , although it is seemingly difficult to contribute for Tohoku region , we can do it in some way or other .
0	147267	http://lang-8.com/266647/journals/936948	32	Thus , through my presentation , I would like you to seriously think about what we can do for them .

1	653878	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	1	From my perspective , I strongly disagree with the statement that the help from government is often not necessary since most people can solve their problems by themselves or with the help from their families .	I strongly disagree that the help from government is often not necessary since most people can solve their problems by themselves or with the help of their families .
1	653879	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	2	On the contrary with the statement , I believe that even people may receive helps somewhere else , the helps from government , in some cases , is what citizens need most , because of government 's authorities and tremendous powers .	On the contrary ( or In contrary ) , I believe that even if people receive help somewhere else , the help from government , in some cases , is what citizens need most , because of government 's tremendous powers .
1	653880	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	3	Besides , offering various helps is a government 's obligatoriness , no matter such help would be regarded as unnecessary or not .	Besides , offering various help is a government 's obligation , whether it ` s necessary or not .
0	653881	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	4	First of all , since government has tremendous power in managing the country and intervening international affairs , the help offered by government could be something can not be offered by individual 's strength , like environment protection , national defence system and disaster relief .
0	653882	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	5	I still remember the deadly earthquake happened in Sichuan , China in 2008 , which exceeded magnitude 8 . 0 , and made that little town suddenly a living hell .
0	653883	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	6	In that kind of situation , can one expect helps from families or friends which may at the same time suffered either ?
0	653884	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	7	No way .
0	653885	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	8	Government 's aid was what they need and only need at that time .
0	653886	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	9	Fortunately , just 90 minutes after the earthquake , Premier Wen Jiabao flew to the earthquake area to oversee the rescue work .
0	653887	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	10	Soon afterwards , over 10 emergency medical teams and 50000 troops were dispatched to help with disaster relief work .
0	653888	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	11	I should say , everyone who has been through that period in China may never say that help from government is not necessary , because we saw the efforts government exerted on rescue and its amazing effects .
0	653889	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	12	From the bottom of my heart I felt that when facing macro issues , government is much more a reliable source than weak individuals .
0	653890	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	13	Besides , I do believe that offering various helps to its citizens is a government 's obligatoriness , no matter some people would think such helps are unnecessary or not .
0	653891	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	14	First , because of diversity of demographic distribution , people is in various different needs .
0	653892	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	15	What you perceive as unnecessary could be exactly what others desperately long for .
0	653893	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	16	So , there could be always sounds shouting the that the helps offered by government are unnecessary , but that will not be the reason government stops offering help .
0	653894	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	17	Furthermore , offering helps and securing just rights , those are what the government was built up for .
0	653895	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	18	The Declaration of Independence once indicated that men are endowed with unalienable rights that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
0	653896	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	19	That to secure these rights , government are instituted among men .
0	653897	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	20	So government is with inborn responsibility to secure citizens ' right and therefore offer helps .
0	653898	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	21	However , it should also be admitted that , although helps from government are with tremendous powers and effects , some problems involving private feelings or interpersonal relationships are better to be solved by families and friends .
0	653899	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	22	Take myself as an example , last semester I broke up with my boyfriend and I got so upset that I locked myself in my room .
0	653900	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	23	It was my sister 's persuasions on daily bases that brought me out of that hazy days .
0	653901	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	24	In situation like that , helps from government could , in some degree , be seemed like unnecessary .
0	653902	http://lang-8.com/297202/journals/1048138	25	In conclusion , although most people can solve their problems by themselves or with the help from their families , the help from government , in most situations , should not be regarded as unnecessary , since government could offer helps that can not be offered by individual strength and it is governments inborn responsibility to do so .

0	725656	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	6	So here is the plan :
0	725657	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	7	1 ) Read at least four books each month .
0	725658	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	8	A novel is also considered a book .
0	725659	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	9	So I do n't have to read a complex academic book to count one up .
0	725660	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	10	2 ) Try as much as possible to write every day a new entry in English here in Lang - 8 .
1	725661	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	11	I might not be able to keep my promise for the whole semester but I 'll try .	I might not be able to keep my promise for the whole semester , but I 'll try .
0	725662	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	12	3 ) Study a little bit of Spanish every day and write an entry once a week .
1	725663	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	13	I might try to raise the number of entries per week after I get a decent knowledge of Spanish .	I might try to raise the number of entries per week , after I get a decent knowledge of Spanish .
0	725664	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	14	But I 'll just wait to see what I can do .
0	725665	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	15	4 ) Fight procrastination , which was my major problem in the last semester .
0	725666	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	16	I had to leave assignments until the last minute .
0	725667	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	17	I used to feel very stressed when I did that but I could n't stop procrastinating .
0	725668	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	18	The same with lectures , actually , lectures were much worse .
1	725669	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	19	I did n't even have any time to think about procrastinating this one .	I did n't even have time to think about procrastinating there .
0	725670	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	20	5 ) I really would like to start studying hardware , because I would like my graduation project to be something that combines between hardware and software .
0	725671	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	21	I know it 's not going to be easy .
0	725672	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	22	It might require doubling my effort and a lot of sleepless nights .
0	725673	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	23	Actually , I enrolled in a competition for that matter but I 'm not sure that one semester is enough .
1	725674	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	24	But as Flawless group from Britain 's got talent said , `` Chase the dream , no the competition . `` I just hope that I could make it , not necessarily before the end of the competition but it 'd be nice if it was accomplished for the graduation project .	But as the group Flawless from Britain 's Got Talent said , `` Chase the dream , not the competition . `` I just hope that I can make it . Not necessarily before the end of the competition , but it 'd be nice if it was accomplished in time for my graduation project .
0	725675	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	25	You might find this plan very lame or nothing worth attention , but to me , accomplishing these tiny goals would make a huge difference in my life .
1	725676	http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/388570	26	I keep pushing myself to always be optimistic , but there are some moments when I find this a very hard thing to do , who does n't ? !

0	947782	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	1	Study with a group

0	947784	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	3	Study alone , and study with a group .
0	947785	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	4	Many parents are saying that it is better to study alone .
0	947786	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	5	However somebodies are claiming that study with a group is better than studying alone .
0	947787	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	6	By the way , the reason why I am writing about this is because I am going to write an essay about this topic .
0	947788	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	7	First of all , I think studying alone is better than studying with a group .
0	947789	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	8	Here are the reasons .
0	947790	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	9	First , we can concentrete well because if we study with a group , you will make many friends who are belonging to the group , and you can talk with you friends during studying .
0	947791	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	10	But , if we study alone , there is n't person who can talk with us , thus we can concentrate on our study more better .
0	947792	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	11	For example , if we study in a group , there is n't enough time to study .
1	947793	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	12	You will talk with your friends , you and your friends want to play outside , but there are n't any parents who will mortify about this things , therefore you may play outside and do n't study .	We will talk with our friends , we will want to play outside with our friends , but there are n't any parents who will discipline us for these things , therefore we may play outside and not study .
1	947794	http://lang-8.com/108876/journals/741276	13	However , if we study alone , normally we study in our home , so there is n't any partner to talk , although we really want to play outside , there is n't enough friends to play , and your parents will mortify about this .

0	841106	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	0	January is almost over !
0	841107	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	1	Thirty days have already passed since the new year started .
0	841108	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	2	Time goes by as if it is getting faster and faster .
0	841109	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	3	Today is already the end of January so I think It is a good time to review if I could start the good yearor not .
0	841110	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	4	Our business was alright ; not bad , not very good under the worst conditions .
0	841111	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	5	Our company is still doing well financially .
0	841112	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	6	Of course I do n't expect that we will make big profit in the next couple of years but we will be OK .
0	841113	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	7	We have been well prepared .
0	841114	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	8	It seems the world economy is getting worse and worse .
0	841115	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	9	This situation of the world economy is perfectly described as the domino effect .
0	841116	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	10	It seems no one can stop the rapid downturn .
0	841117	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	11	I think the first priority for people is to help each other and rescue the people victimized by this economic crisis .
0	841118	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	12	Many people are losing their jobs as well as a place to live although they are healthy and are willing to work .
0	841119	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	13	Talking about my English , I think I could make a good start !
0	841120	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	14	I have finished reading six books .
0	841121	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	15	I still do n't feel my reading got better dramatically , but I surely believe that if I continue to read , it will make a big difference in the near future .
0	841122	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	16	I took the conversation class almost every day .
0	841123	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	17	I read articles a lot and spoke a lot with Philliphina tutors in English .
0	841124	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	18	I feel my speaking has been getting faster and more accurate little by little .
0	841125	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	19	I am happy about it .
0	841126	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	20	I think the slowest improvement is still listening .
0	841127	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	21	I have watched and listened to CBS news and one of the American talk radio stations everyday .
0	841128	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	22	But I still hardly understand what they are saying ; especially the radio .
0	841129	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	23	In some particular areas in the topics , my listenning ability drops a lot .
0	841130	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	24	What disapointed me the most was how well I did listening to Obama 's inauguration speech .
0	841131	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	25	I could only understand about 20 to 30 percent of his historical speech .
0	841132	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	26	Anyway , our business was OK and I was able to enjoy learning English a lot during January .
0	841133	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	27	I am pretty satisfied with the result .
0	841134	http://lang-8.com/25755/journals/78988	28	I hope the rest of the year will remain the same . ^ ^
